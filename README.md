# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Write a Java method that takes in an array and returns the reverse.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to iterate backwards over the inputted array and define the values of the new array in order with each iteration.

# Shift an Array

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to create an empty array with a length of the inputted array + 1, then iterate over it, skipping the middle index while adding the values from the inputted array, then finally setting the middle index to be the inputted value.

# Array Binary Search

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to start at the middle by taking the input array length / 2, then begin a while-loop where I compare the value at that index to the search key and keep track of the index of comparison. If the search key wasn't found, I add or subtract half of the difference between the input array length and the tracked index value to the index value, which continuously halves the current index value while moving towards the search key. If the maximum or minimum index values are reached and the search key isn't found, I return -1;

# Linked List

## Challenge
Create a linked list class, with a method that adds a new Node to the head of the list. Add methods to insert a node before and after a node with a given value, and at the end of the list. Add a method that converts the list into a string of Node values. Add a method that returns true or false if a given value exists in the Linked List.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach inserts new nodes at the head of the list, so that inserting new nodes is O(1) rather than O(n).

## API
-`insert(int value)` Inserts a new Node into the Linked List 
-`includes(int input)` Checks the value of each Node in the list agains the input and returns true if found, false if not. 
-`[Node].listToString()` Prints each value of the Linked List starting at the specified Node in "{ [Node value] } -> { [next Node value] } ->..." format. Call it on the head to print the entire list.
-`append(int value)` Inserts a new Node at the end of the list.
-`insertBefore(int value, int newVal)` Uses includes() to check if `value` exists in the LL, and if it does, inserts a new Node with value `newVal` before it.
-`insertAfter(int value, int newVal)` Uses includes() to check if `value` exists in the LL, and if it does, inserts a new Node with value `newVal` after it.
