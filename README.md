# Reverse an Array
401 Java challenge #1.

## Challenge
Write a Java method that takes in an array and returns the reverse.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to iterate backwards over the inputted array and define the values of the new array in order with each iteration.

## Solution

# Shift an Array
401 Java challenge #2.

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to create an empty array with a length of the inputted array + 1, then iterate over it, skipping the middle index while adding the values from the inputted array, then finally setting the middle index to be the inputted value.
